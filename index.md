The Open Africa Network project is a project to establish an open network of payment systems operators, primarily in emerging markets, that has a low cost of participation. In recent years several successful “eMoney” systems have evolved in this arena, but are very disparate and lack any consistent interaction or oversight protocols. Enter stage left, Interledger. 

## Interledger Protocol

The [Interledger Protocol (ILP)](https://interledger.org) is a protocol for internetworking existing payment networks using a universal account addressing scheme and a unique two-phase clearing flow with cryptographic assurances of payment exchanged between the payer and payee.

By using ILP participants in a payment isolate their risk exposure to only the immediate scheme/network they participate in allowing payments to be source, routed and delivered across multiple existing (and even new blockchain-based) networks.

## Motivation

Interoperability and reach are widely accepted as the major roadblocks to widespread adoption of digital payments in Africa, especially among the poor. Traditional card-based retail payment networks operate on prohibitively expensive models that must cater for dispute resolution, chargeback risk and system-wide reconciliation costs.

The Gates Foundation’s [Level One Project](https://leveloneproject.org) has demonstrated that a modern, inclusive payments system must abide by 6 core principles[1]():

  - A push payment model with immediate funds transfer and same day settlement
  - Open-loop interoperability between providers
  - Adherence to well-defined and adopted international standards
  - Adequate system-wide shared fraud and security protection
  - Efficient and proportional identity and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements
  - Meeting or exceeding the convenience, cost and utility of cash

In keeping with these principals the foundation has adopted ILP at the core of its work on a robust, low-cost shared digital financial services infrastructure including their [Mojaloop](https://mojaloop.io), open-source, clearing system project.

The Open Africa Network project aims to take this torch and run with it by deploying ILP-enabled nodes into existing payments networks in Africa and peering these together to create a continent-wide open payment network.

## Approach

The Open Africa Network is being spearheaded by some of the continents most successful and fastest-growing financial technology companies including [Ecentric](http://www.ecentric.co.za/), [Waxed Mobile](https://www.waxedmobile.com/) and [wiGroup](https://www.wigroupinternational.com/) with assistance from the Interledger protocol team at [Ripple](https://ripple.com).

These business fulfill numerous roles in the ecosystem including payment initiation across numerous channels, payment authorization from a variety of funding sources, transaction switching and funds settlement.

In participating in the network, each business will commit to running an Interledger node and peering with one or more of the other participants. Participants that peer directly will agree on payment limits, and a mechanism and cadence to settle their bilateral accounts.

Initially this will form a small network with limited coverage in terms of initiation, acceptance and use case but the goal will be to grow this organically, adding new payment types, and network participants.

The initial network will focus on diversity of funding sources (EFT, card, crypto-currency), settlement participants and payment initiation channels (QR code, USSD, other) to demonstrate the interoperability between different participants.

## Participants

The current participants of this consortium have unique experience in emerging markets, and contribute world leading market differentiators that make the combined offering unique.

### wiGroup

wiGroup was established in 2008 as one of the world’s first virtualised payment technologies in the form of “wiWallet” where bank cards were virtualised, tokenised, vaulted and transacted against using time based numeric OTP’s in brick and mortar retail. In the cruel wait for “trend curve riding” wiGroup have spend 6 years and nearly $12 million developing some of the best digital transactional loyalty, rewards and Mcommerce software in the world. With new shareholders Virgin Group and Investec Private Equity, wiGroup is perfectly positioned to spring board their SaaS offerings around and within the EMON network and contribute in a meaningful way to this industry changing initiative. 

### Waxd mobile

Waxd mobile is an API aggregator which offer a single API (Web or App Plugin) to merchants that allow their customers (from participating banks) to make fast EFT payments in the same seamless manner as card. Customers can make a direct push payment from their chosen bank accounts. This neatly circumvents the need for a “debit pull” transaction and all associated repudiation and settlement costs.

Waxd is working with major South African banks in developing and exposing their API's. Our software and processes assist the banks in commercialising their API's giving a more polished product to the market. Fees are lower than traditional card & card not present fees. 

Their processes have been approved by the Payments Association of South Africa (PASA) and Waxd is a certified Systems Operator within this body.
